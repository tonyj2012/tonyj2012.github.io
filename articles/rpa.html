      <h1> Will RPA Take Human Jobs? </h1>
      <p> Everyone has been there. You look around at all the automation around you and wonder how long it will be before your job becomes automated.
But what if there was a way to use automation to improve efficiency without costing jobs?
Robotic process automation, or RPA, is a method of automation that could do just that.
But will RPA take human jobs? The short answer is no.
Keep reading to find out exactly what RPA is and why it won't cost jobs based on historical context.
      </p>
      <h3> History of Automation </h3>
      <p> Automation has always been a part of the way people do things. Even the earliest civilizations thought about how they could automate repeated actions and tasks.
As early as the 3rd century BCE, the ancient Greeks and Arabs built simple machines to automatically keep track of the passage of time. Over the centuries, automation became more widespread and sophisticated.
One of the biggest examples of automation occurred during the Industrial Revolution. This was a time of vast improvements in the automation of simple tasks in the manufacturing and textiles industries.
From the cotton gin to the steam engine, efficiency and productivity greatly improved with the automation that came during the Industrial Revolution. But what happened to the people who previously did these things by hand?
Even during the Industrial Revolution, there were many people who thought automation would lead to a severe lack of jobs and economic collapse. However, progress gave way to automation anyway.
History has shown that these skeptics were mistaken. Economists conclude that automation during the Industrial Revolution allowed people to focus on other tasks that couldn't be automated.
Some people couldn't do the same things they were doing before, but they found other ways to contribute.
      </p>
      <h3> History of Robotics </h3>
      <p> The Industrial Revolution isn't the only example from history that shows the benefits of automation. Everyone knows about the progression of mechanical and electronic computers during and after World War II.
Before these, however, the term "computer" referred to a person who did calculations by hand. So what happened to these people when these calculations became automated?
Many of the people who previously did computations by hand learned how to build and operate the new mechanical and electronic computers.
As the computer industry exploded over the next few decades, the demand for jobs has surpassed the number of jobs taken up by people who did computations by hand.
However, even during this sharp rise in the computer industry, the concept of a robot was still foreign to most people. Throughout most of the 20th century, robots were confined to science fiction stories about a possible future.
In fact, the term robot even comes from a science fiction play written in 1920. However, the word robot has changed a lot since then. It has come to mean any machine that can perform repetitive tasks.
In addition, robots are now everywhere, from movies to videos of real robots built in a lab.
      </p>
      <h3> What Is RPA? </h3>
      <p> Now that we've looked at some of the histories behind robotics and automation, let's look at what robotic process automation actually means.
Normally, when you think of a robot, it's something physical. It's a machine that moves around and does simple tasks.
However, the robotic part of RPA refers to software. It is completely digital.
In addition, it is different from the typical methods of automation in software systems. Normally, a programmer or developer has to write code that automates a specific task.
With RPA, those instructions are written automatically. It seems like a kind of automation of automation, but how does that work? The RPA system looks at how the user interacts with the user interface to learn what to automate.
You just need a user to interact with the system for the RPA to start learning how to automate the tasks it needs to do. This means that RPA systems aren't limited to a single area.
RPA systems can handle transfers of information between different applications. When looking at the effect of RPA vs. human tasks, RPA systems can do almost everything a human would do automatically.
So then is RPA the end of human jobs?
      </p>
      <h3> Will RPA Take Human Jobs? </h3>
      <p> The question of whether or not RPA systems will take jobs away from real people is important to consider. You may be asking, "will RPA lose my job?"
If you are trying to decide whether or not to switch to RPA for your business, you may be worried about job security with RPA. Considering the historical examples of the Industrial Revolution and the rise of automation within the computer industry, RPA job security is generally safe.
One of the many benefits of RPA is that it allows employees to focus on tasks that require ingenuity instead of doing repetitive tasks all the time.
For example, without RPA, someone might have to open an email and transfer data into a spreadsheet. With RPA, however, this can all be done automatically.
This leaves more time for employees to handle things that can't be done automatically and allows digital and human workers to work together to improve the business.
