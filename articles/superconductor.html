      <h1> What Is a Superconductor? Everything You Need to Know </h1>
      <p> Everyone has been there. You're trying to buy the perfect gift for someone. One option might be jewelry. But there are so many different kinds of jewelry out there; which kind should you choose?
Whether you're looking for a wedding ring or another piece of jewelry, one new trend is the use of superconductors. But what is a superconductor? Keep reading to find out what it is and how it can be used.
      </p>
      <h3> What Is a Superconductor? </h3>
      <p> A superconductor is the next step after a conductor. It has many amazing and surprising properties that make it useful for a wide variety of applications.</p>
      <h5> Conductivity </h5>
      <p> In general, conductivity is a measure of how well electrons can flow within a material. If electrons flow easily, the material is a conductor, while if they are stuck in place within the material, it is an insulator.
However, it gets more complicated than that with things like semiconductors and superconductors. Even though conductors allow electrons to flow, they still hinder the motion of electrons within the material. This is electrical resistance.
Resistance comes from the fact that the atoms and molecules within a material are constantly moving. The higher the temperature of the material, the faster they are moving around.
The more the atoms move around, the more they get in the way of electrons as they try to flow through the material. This means for most conductive materials, higher temperatures increase the electrical resistance.
So what happens if you cool the material? The resistance of normal conductors decreases as the temperature goes down, but superconductors behave a little differently. They constitute a completely different state of matter.
      </p>
      <h5> A New State of Matter </h5>
      <p> Unlike traditional conductors, superconductors don't gradually reduce in resistance as they get colder. Instead, they go from having some resistance to zero resistance at a particular temperature called the critical temperature.
This happens because something happens to the electrons within the material. At the critical temperature, which is close to absolute zero, atoms are moving slowly, and electrons do something they never do at temperatures we're used to.
At temperatures this low, electrons bind together to form Cooper pairs. These pairs act as single particles instead of individual electrons. This means things like charge and spin are twice what they normally are.
When particles have twice the spin of a single electron, they can all be in the same energy state, which electrons can never do. Since they are all in a single energy state and at a low temperature, there is very little to hinder their flow.
Since the electrons are able to flow so easily through the material, the resistance of the material becomes zero. Materials in this state are in a state of matter that is not a solid, liquid, gas, or plasma.
Instead, it is in a fifth state of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate.
      </p>
      <h3> Superconductor Applications </h3>
      <p> Although they have only been around for a little over a century, superconductors have gone on to be a part of many useful applications. From cutting edge science to cutting edge fashion, superconductors have found a place.      </p>
      <h5> Scientific Applications </h5>
      <p> There have been many important applications in the realm of science for superconductors. Because they have zero resistance, when you place a superconductor near a magnet, it produces its own magnetic field in the opposite direction.
This means superconductors can essentially levitate indefinitely when placed above a magnet. You can even make a track out of magnets that a superconductor can follow.
This is perfect for things like trains. It takes very little energy to get them moving and keep them moving once they start. One drawback to this, however, is the energy required to keep the material in a superconductive state.
Even so, this is a way to make a train that has almost no friction and hence incredible efficiency.
Another common application for superconductors is in particle accelerators like the one at CERN that discovered the Higgs boson. In addition, superconductors are used in nuclear fusion plants which could eventually become a widely used power source.
One application in the field of medical science is the use of superconductors in MRI machines. These machines need very powerful magnets to operate, which they sometimes get from superconductive materials.
      </p>
      <h5> Jewelry </h5>
      <p> Not only are superconductors incredibly useful, but they are also quite beautiful. For this reason, they have become a major part of fashion jewelry. Superconductor rings are becoming more and more common.
If you're thinking of getting a superconductor wedding band, check out these gorgeous rings. The main ring material is traditionally an alloy of niobium and titanium, but some more complex crystal structures are gaining popularity.
In either case, the rings have a sleek metallic look with contrasting silver and copper striations. There are many types of rings, but if you're looking for something new and exciting, superconductor rings may be the right way to go.
In addition to rings, superconductor material can also be made into things like necklaces and bracelets for people who are more interested in this type of jewelry.
