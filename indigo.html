      <p id="text"> You arrive at a large building West of Viridian City. Inside, a guard asks for proof that you've collected all 8 gym badges in the Indigo League.
                     You proceed to a treacherous cave where you are taxed to your last breath. When you get to the end, 
                     you can either go into a large chamber to the side or exit the cave and challenge the Elite Four.</p>
